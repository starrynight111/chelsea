            <p>Born in Saskatchewan and raised in BC. He's an avid lover of video games
            and coffee. Due to growing tired of being a Barista with a Psychology degree,
            he has returned to post-secondary education to pursue a degree in Computing.
            He one day hopes to work for a small independent studio to make games that have
            a soul.</p>
