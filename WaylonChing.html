			<p>What is there to say? Waylon is a simple man from a simple place - that is until he is struck by a radioactive
				lightning emitted from a futuristic lab 7 times!!! Now Waylon studies CST at BCIT with brilliant minds from
				around the world. But I heard BCIT is very intense, I hope he does well.</p>
            <p>Waylon can not be reached; Waylon REACHES you. (His email address is waylonching@gmail.com)</p>
