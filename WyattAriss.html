            <p>My name is Wyatt and I am in set C. I am an amateur MMA fighter. I have trained in such combat 
			   sports as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Boxing, Muay Thai and Wrestling since roughly 2003. I took 3 years 
			   of Geophysics at SFU before changing to computer science for a year and then finally transfering 
			   to BCIT. I have been programming since I was in grade 10 and wanted to make a ZORK clone. I have a
			   pretty good understanding of most of the stuff being covered in the CST classes this semester so 
			   if anyone needs help with something feel free to send me a message. Everyone is welcome to add me 
			   on facebook, though I rarely use it.
