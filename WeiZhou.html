            <p>He was born in a village near Guangzhou, China where door locks are left unused most of the time.
                Then he moved to Vancouver some very long time ago and has called this city his home ever since.
                He enjoys games that requires constant research and analysis, but does not gurantee victory even
                when all things done right. The database option in the CST program would be his only pick.</p>
