            <p>Ariana was born in North Vancouver and shortly after, moved to Port Coquitlam. 
               She pursued competitive gymnastics for six years before shifting her focus to 
               martial arts instead. She likes martial arts better because she can punch people
               in the face and call it training. In her spare time, she likes to game on her Xbox;
               however, her Xbox is currently broken, so you can donate to the 'Help Ariana get a
               new Xbox' fund. In her last year of high school, Ariana decided to take the BCIT 
               CST program, and she's liking it so far. </p>

            <p>Ariana can be reached at a.rian.a@asdfghkjl.com (If you really need to 
               reach her, just find her on Facebook. Don't worry, she won't think it's creepy.)</p>
