            <p>Meghan was born and raised in the Lower Mainland of BC. After a career in Visual Effects and Animation, she decided a change of
            pace was needed and entered the BCIT CST program. Some of Meghan's favourite things are fantasy novels, roleplaying videogames, and
            cats. The one in the picture is named Wesley. He is a butthead.</p>
