            <p>Born and raised in Vancouver, Sophia wanted to become a professor of classical literature
                before doing a 180 and pursuing a more realistic career in computer science. She has been
                coding VB.net and SQL for a few years and hopes to eventually work in a database related
                field.  </p>
